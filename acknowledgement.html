            <p>
                First and foremost, we would like to express our special thanks of gratitude to our
                teacher Mr. Hem Prasad Thapliya for providing us this this golden opportunity to
                prepare this project report on the topic “<span style="font-weight: bold;">Cyber Law and Security</span>”. This project
                helped to explore various topics like Cyber Law, Cyber Security, Cyber Crimes,
                Cyber Attacks etc. in a deeper basis which enhanced our knowledge in those fields.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Besides, we would like to thank all the teachers who helped us by giving us advice
                and providing the information which we required in order to prepare a proper
                report on the given topic.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Also I would like to thank my family and friends for their support. Without that support we couldn't have succeeded in completing this project and submitting it on time. 
            </p>
